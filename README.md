# COSC-4353 Software Design Group 29 Project

## Project Description
This project involves the design and development of a web application to predict fuel rates based on specific criteria provided by a partner company. The application aims to facilitate fuel rate prediction for clients based on their location, history, requested gallons, and company profit margin. The project focuses on software design principles and high-level architecture.

## Technology Stacks
- Frontend:
Our frontend development utilizes a combination of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. We enhance responsiveness and user experience with Bootstrap and manage components efficiently using ReactJS.

- Backend:
For backend development, MySQL serves as our database management system, while Node.js runs our server-side logic. These technologies together ensure secure and efficient data management and server-side processing.

By leveraging this technology stack, we aim to develop a robust and scalable software application that meets the project requirements and adheres to modern software design principles and high-level architecture.


## Components and Functionalities
The web application must include the following components and functionalities:

1. **Login:**
   - Allow clients to log in.
   - Provide registration for new clients.

2. **Client Registration:**
   - Initially, username and password.

3. **Client Profile Management:**
   - Clients must complete their profiles after registration by logging in.
   - Manage client information and preferences.

4. **Fuel Quote Form with Pricing Module:**
   - Provide a form for clients to input:
     - Client location (in-state or out-of-state).
     - Client history (existing customer with previous purchase or new).
     - Gallons requested.
     - Company profit margin (%).
   - Calculate fuel rates based on the provided criteria.
   - Display the total cost to the client.

5. **Fuel Quote History:**
   - Maintain a history of fuel quotes for each client.
   - Allow clients to view their past quotes.

## Instructions 
- Users should log in to access the application's functionalities.
- New users must register before logging in.
- After logging in, users can complete their profiles.
- The fuel quote form allows users to input relevant information for rate prediction.
- The history section displays past fuel quotes for reference.
